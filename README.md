# Dataset Exploration for Ford GoBike System Data

This project is a part of **Udacity ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree**.

## Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. <br>

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. <br>
In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area: <br>

 - Trip Duration (Seconds).
 - Trip Start Time and Date.
 - Trip End Time and Date.
 - Start Station ID.
 - Start Station Name.
 - Start Station Latitude.
 - Start Station Longitude
 - End Station ID.
 - End Station Name.
 - End Station Latitude.
 - End Station Longitude.
 - Bike ID.
 - User Type : ['Subscriber', 'Customer']
 - Member Birth Year.
 - Member Gender.
 - Bike Share for All Trip : ['No','Yes']


## Summary of Findings

> - The most common user type is **Subscriber** with **90.53%**.
> - **Male** is the most bike user gender.
> - The bike users birth year from **1878** to **2001**.
> - The **most common age group** for bike users' birth year is from **1979** to **2001**.
> - The most popular for bikes is **not sharing** for all trip.
> - San Francisco Bay area has **329** Bike Stations.
> - The most common **start station** is **Market St at 10th St**.
> - The most common **end station** is **San Francisco Caltrain Station 2  (Townsend St at 4th St)**.
> - The **average** of the trip duration is **704.002744 seconds** (12 minutes).
> - The most common bike users are **Subscribers** from **Males**.
> - Bike sharing for all trip is only available to **Subscriber**.
> - The most common trip **durations** are **below 6000 seconds** and **ages** between **20 and 60**.
> - The customers have longer trip duration than the subscribers.
> - Females have longer trip duration than Males.
> - User type has **no effect** on the relationship between age and trip duration.
> - User gender has **no effect** on the relationship between age and trip duration.
> - Bike sharing for all trip has **no effect** on the relationship between age and trip duration.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> - There is no relationship between **(bike sharing for all trip - user gender - user type)** and the relationship between **age and trip duration**. <br>
> - **Finally**, Most common bike users' persona is **Male** who is a **subscriber** with **age** between **20 and 60** years old.
